#About App
This is an app that is being made on andriod studios, by using Kotlin as the programing language.
This app is based on a classic game where uses have to find over 2 cards and see if they are a match.
in this app players are given 3 levels of difficulity from 2x4, 3x6, and 3x6 tiles. On top of the default
the user can custom their tiles with pictures from their own picture library to play the game. In addition
to this, users can also save their custom games and people with that name can then use the created game
name to play on their end. this is achieved by implementing Firebase. 

#Things that can be worked on
The downside of this app is that it requires wifi for custome games to be made, and depending on the internet
connection it can take a while for everything to be uploaded. During this uploading time the user will have to 
wait everything is uploded then contine with the game which is not something that is prefeared by users. This
is something that has to be worked on by implementing background uploading so the interface will look faster to 
the user. However this is beyond my knowledge so I will try and work on this in the near future.
