# Memory_Game
This is an app that is being made on andriod studios.
This app is a classic app that allows user to flip over
cards in order to match them. An added bounus to this app is that 
users can use their own pictures to create an custome game of their
own. User can also share the game with friends and families becasue 
this app uses firebase as storage. 


The downside of this app is that it requires wifi for custome games
and it can take a while for pictures to be uploaded and used. This
is something that has to be worked on by using background uploading
so the interface will look faster to the user but it is actually hard
at work while the game is being played.
